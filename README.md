DETECTING IF A DRIVER IS DRUNK OR NOT USING FACIAL IMAGES AND PREVENTING IGNITION IF HE IS FOUND DRUNK
PROCESS:
THE DRIVER GETS INTO THE CAR AND TRIES TO TURN ON THE IGNITION----->
HIS PHOTO IS TAKEN FROM THE CAMERA ON THE DASHBOARD AND THE IMAGES ARE PROCESSED BY THE MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHM---->
IF HE IS DETECTED AS SOBER THE ENGINE STARTS
IF NOT, HE IS INFORMED THAT HE IS DRUNK AND HE IS GIVEN 3 MORE CHANCES TO PROVE HIMSELF AS NON DRUNK--->
IF ALL THE THREE TIMES THE SYSTEM DECIDES THAT HE IS DRUNK, THE DRIVER NEEDS TO BE CHANGED TO DRIVE THE CAR.

ADVANTAGES:
CAR WONT START UNTIL DRIVER IS DETECTED AS NON DRUNK SO DRIVER CANT COVER THE CAMERA INORDER TO FOOL THE SYSTEM.

THE RASPBERRY PI MODULE IS FITTED INSIDE THE CAR INBETWEEN THE IGNITION KEY AND THE CAR BATTERY,THUS MAKING IT THEFT AND BREAK PROOF
